# PixelCraft- Creative Agency Services Page

##  Overview

This project is a **responsive Services Page** designed for a Creative/Tech Agency. It demonstrates both **fundamental CSS techniques** (Flexbox, Grid, transitions) and **modern approaches** (Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, responsive classes, and dark mode).

##  Design Approaches

1. **Structure & Layout**

   * A clear **Hero section** introduces the page with a title, description, and call-to-action button.
   * The **Services Grid** uses **CSS Grid (or Tailwind grid utilities)** to display 8 service cards with icons, titles, short descriptions, and links.
   * A **CTA section** at the bottom reinforces user action (contact or view more work).

2. **Responsiveness**

   * Designed to work seamlessly across **desktop, tablet, and mobile**.
   * In the Tailwind version, breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) ensure adaptive layouts without extra media queries.

3. **Interactivity & UX**

   * **Hover effects** on cards (scale, shadow, overlay) to create a modern feel.
   * **Category filters** (via JavaScript) to dynamically show/hide cards.
   * **Modal popups** provide more details without leaving the page.
   * Smooth **scroll animations** enhance user engagement.

4. **Advanced Styling**

   * **Custom CSS transitions** for hover/filters.
   * **Dark/Light mode toggle** using Tailwindâ€™s built-in support and CSS variables for consistency.
   * Optional **AOS.js or CSS keyframes** for scroll animations.

##  Key Takeaways

* Showcases **core CSS3 skills** (Grid, Flexbox, transitions, responsiveness).
* Demonstrates **modern CSS with Tailwind** for faster, scalable design.
* Enhances **user experience** with interactivity, animations, and clean UI patterns.
